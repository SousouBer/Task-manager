                The demand for solar panel installation services has grown
                rapidly over the past years. However, there is no software the
                solar panel installation businesses can use to manage their
                projects end-to-end. Companies find it hard to track, store and
                analyze all project-related information and materials. This
                often leads to failed or poorly executed projects.Â
